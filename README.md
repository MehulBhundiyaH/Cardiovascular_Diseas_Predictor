**Overview :**

This project aims to enhance the early detection of cardiovascular diseases by correlating Korotkoff sounds with blood vessel health. By implementing advanced signal processing techniques and applying machine learning algorithms, this project has achieved a 22% improvement in the early detection of vascular anomalies. A website is also being developed to make this tool accessible and user-friendly.

**Features :**

Advanced Signal Processing: Utilizes FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to extract, denoise, and analyze relevant signal data from Korotkoff sounds.
Machine Learning: Applies machine learning models to interpret processed signals and predict cardiovascular diseases.
Web Development: A user-friendly website is being developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to facilitate easy access and interaction with the predictor.
